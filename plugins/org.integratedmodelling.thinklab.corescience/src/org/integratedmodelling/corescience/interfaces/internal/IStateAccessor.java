 * contextualizers. Conceptual models that don't have access to datasources are expected to use 
 * an accessor to implement mediation of their dependencies.
 * 
 * In case the observation depends on others, the accessor will be notified of the observables that it 
 * depends upon in the sequence known to the contextualizer, so that they can be matched to what is 
 * known to the CM (e.g. variable names in expressions) and they will be retrievable at contextualization 
 * using their notification index.
