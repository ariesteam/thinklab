/**
 * A gazetteer is a queriable so it can be serched with whatever query its method parseQuery will
 * return. The QueryResult returned from a query must have a "shape" field (SHAPE_FIELD in 
 * constants) which returns the ShapeValue corresponding to the result. All other fields are
 * implementation-dependent, but as a rule we should have "id" and "name" always, plus 
 * "label" and "description" optionally.
 * 
 * The gazetteer can also be searched using resolve(), which will normally return one result
 * searched by unique ID, although the implementation does not enforce that.
