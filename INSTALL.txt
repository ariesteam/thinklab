* Repository management:

1) Create an account on http://github.com.

2) Make two new empty repositories on GitHub, called thinklab and
   aries.

3) Setup SSH public/private keys between your Git program and GitHub.

4) From Git Bash, run these global Git configuration commands:

   $ git config --global user.name  "Your Name"
   $ git config --global user.email "your.email@server.com"

5) Make a directory called repository on your computer to hold the
   thinklab and aries code.

6) Use Git to clone git://github.com/lambdatronic/thinklab.git and
   git://github.com/lambdatronic/aries.git into repository/thinklab
   and repository/aries respectively.  Note: This automatically
   creates a local master branch in your thinklab and aries
   repositories.

7) Configure your Git remotes with these Git Bash commands:

   First in the thinklab directory:
   $ git remote rename origin gary
   $ git remote add ferd git://github.com/fvilla/thinklab.git
   $ git remote add ken git://github.com/kbagstad/thinklab.git
   $ git remote add brian git@github.com:bvoigt/thinklab.git

   Then in the aries directory:
   $ git remote rename origin gary
   $ git remote add ferd git://github.com/fvilla/aries.git
   $ git remote add ken git://github.com/kbagstad/aries.git
   $ git remote add brian git@github.com:bvoigt/aries.git

8) Use Git to fetch the latest updates from each of these repositories
   (gary, ferd, and ken, NOT brian).

9) Create and checkout a local dev branch in each of the thinklab and
   aries repositories based off of gary/dev, using Git Bash like so:

   First in the thinklab directory:
   $ git checkout -b dev gary/dev

   Then in the aries directory:
   $ git checkout -b dev gary/dev

10) Use Git to push your thinklab and aries repos to the brian
    remotes, which copies everything up to your GitHub account.


* Java and Ant configuration:

IMPORTANT: If you have any JREs installed (excluding the ones which
           come with your JDKs), uninstall them now, or they will
           cause you no end of headaches as you go through this
           process.

1) Setup the following system-wide environment variables:

  ANT_HOME=<Apache Ant installation directory>
  JAVA_HOME=<JDK1.6 installation directory>
  JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx2048M              <-- or however much memory you can spare
  PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin
  HOME=%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%

  ARIES_SRC=<aries repository directory>
  ARIES_HOME=<aries installation directory>
  ARIES_GAZETTEERS_HOME=%HOME%\.thinklab
  THINKLAB_SRC=<thinklab repository directory>
  THINKLAB_HOME=<thinklab installation directory>
  THINKLAB_PLUGINS=%ARIES_HOME%\plugins

2) Test that this configuration works by opening a terminal and
   running:

  $ java -version
  $ ant -version

  Both commands should simply print out the version information for
  the JDK1.6 and Apache Ant programs that you have installed.

3) You can now compile thinklab and aries by running the
   %THINKLAB_HOME%\bin\build_thinklab.bat and
   %ARIES_HOME%\bin\build_aries.bat scripts.  To make this easier, put
   shortcuts to these two files on your desktop.

4) You can start aries by running the
   %THINKLAB_HOME%\bin\run_thinklab.bat script.  This will give you
   the familiar Thinklab prompt.

5) Remember to recompile and restart aries if you make any changes to
   its files.


* RiskWiz configuration

1) Edit this file:

  %HOME%\.thinklab\data\org.integratedmodelling.thinklab.riskwiz\config\riskwiz.config

2) Uncomment this line:

  thinklab.bayesian.engine = riskwiz


* ClojureBox configuration:

Since we really just want to run Emacs with an installed clojure-mode
and paredit-mode, using ClojureBox makes this setup totally painless
(since it's the default).  However, running the ClojureBox program
puts us in Emacs at a SLIME REPL for testing Clojure code dynamically.
This isn't our goal here, so we have to tweak the program so it just
fires up a properly setup Emacs instance.

1) Edit C:\Program Files(x86)\ClojureBox\emacs\site-lisp\default.el by
   commenting out the last three lines in the file (prefix each one
   with ;;) and adding a single right-paren on a line by itself at the
   end of the file.

2) Save default.el and run ClojureBox.  You should see a plain Emacs
   *scratch* buffer.  If so, you're in business!

3) Using Windows Explorer, navigate to
   %ARIES_SRC%\plugins\org.integratedmodelling.aries.core\models.

4) Check to make sure that all *.clj files in this directory are
   automatically associated with ClojureBox.  If not associate the
   *.clj file extension with this program.

5) Using Windows Explorer, navigate to
   %ARIES_SRC%\plugins\org.integratedmodelling.aries.administration\data.

6) Check to make sure that all *.xml files in this directory are
   automatically associated with ClojureBox.  If not associate the
   *.xml file extension with this program.

Please note that when you open a file for editing with ClojureBox, the
Emacs instance that pops up is a server.  When you are finished
editing the file, save it and press the X button in the Emacs toolbar,
NOT the X button on the top right corner of the window.  This will
close the file, but leave Emacs running.  When you click on other
files to edit, they will automatically appear in the running Emacs
window.  Please note that you can open any number of files in Emacs at
the same time.  To switch between the different files you have open,
use the Emacs Buffers menu.  Note that Save Buffer is C-x C-s.

Also note that Emacs is an extremely versatile and adaptable editor.

If you want Windows-style cut-and-paste keybindings (C-z, C-x, C-c,
C-v), these are very easy to setup.  Simply check "Use CUA Bindings"
under the Options menu.

If you want to see tabs for the different files you have open instead
of having to use the Buffers menu, this is also very easy to setup.
Download tabbar.el (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/tabbar.el)
and place it in a directory called %HOME%\elisp.  Create a file called
%HOME%\.emacs and add these lines to it (obviously replacing
yourusername with your actual user name):

;; Begin Emacs Configuration

(add-to-list 'load-path "C:/Users/yourusername/elisp")
(require 'tabbar)

(tabbar-mode 1)

(define-key global-map [(ctrl left)] 'tabbar-backward)
(define-key global-map [(ctrl right)] 'tabbar-forward)

(setq-default tab-width 4)
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

(setq make-backup-files nil)

;; End Emacs Configuration

Once you've done this, save the .emacs file and restart ClojureBox.
You can now use Ctrl Left-Arrow and Ctrl Right-Arrow to cycle between
the currently opened buffers in your Emacs session.

This configuration will also prevent Emacs from creating backup files
like foo.clj~ whenever you save a file and will standardize tabstops
at 4 spaces, thereby keeping your code nice and clean.


* PostgreSQL/PostGIS configuration

In order to run models, Thinklab/ARIES needs access to a local
database where it can store mappings between its modelling concepts
and the (possibly remote) datasources that will supply them with
values as needed.  We'll use PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extensions to
set this up.

1) Start up your PostgreSQL server as a background service.  You might
   want to configure this to startup automatically whenever you login.

2) Run pgAdminIII to get a graphical PostgreSQL client running.

3) Connect to your database server and create two new databases with
   these settings:

   Name: ariesdata
   Encoding: UTF8
   Template: template_postgis (you did remember to install PostGIS, right?)
   Owner: postgres (this is the default PostgreSQL administrator account)

   Name: <your_username>
   Encoding: UTF8
   Template: template_postgis
   Owner: postgres

4) To populate the ariesdata database, start up ARIES with the
   %THINKLAB_HOME%\bin\run_thinklab.bat script.  At the prompt, type:

   > pload aries
   > pload administration
   > run aries.initdb

   If everything runs without errors, you are ready to go!  Note that
   you will need an internet connection for this procedure to work as
   ARIES must connect to one or more remote geoservers to build up its
   datasource mappings.

5) Next open
   %HOME%.thinklab/data/org.integratedmodelling.thinklab.sql/config/sql.properties
   with ClojureBox and add these lines at the end:

   thinklab.sql.user=postgres
   thinklab.sql.password=<your_database_administrator_password>
   thinklab.sql.host=localhost

6) Save the file and exit.

7) Back at your aries prompt:

   > gazetteer create

   This creates and initializes your gazetteer database, so that you
   can construct model contexts from WFS-accessible Shapefiles.

8) Exit ARIES like so:

   > exit

9) Done!  Now get to modelling!
